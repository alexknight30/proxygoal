This file summarizes both the 100-question and 2,500-question experiments.

- 100-question figure:  results/figures/accuracy_by_variant_20250920.png
- 2,500-question summary: results/tables/summary_2500.csv
- 2,500-question figure:  results/figures/accuracy_by_variant_2500.png

Interpretation:
- Normal: High alignment with the true objective (robust_acc close to naive_acc).
- Proxy: Clear reward hacking; naive_acc >> robust_acc. Expect longer outputs and more numbers, increasing misaligned_rate.
- Shifted: Same questions in words; check for drops vs. normal. In our first run, no drop was observed.

Why 2,500?
- Larger n reduces variance and gives more stable estimates of misaligned_rate and accuracy.
